# Setup

To use this, make sure to install the dependencies using npm.

```shell
npm install
```

this should install the node modules that are dependencies for this project (should be the 'express' package).

then, to run this server, first go to the directory that contains the project, and then run:

```shell
node app.js
```

this runs the 'app.js' file.
